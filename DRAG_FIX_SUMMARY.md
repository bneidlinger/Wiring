# Drag Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Event Handling Conflicts**: svg-pan-zoom was intercepting mouse events
2. **Tool Initialization**: Select tool wasn't being initialized on app startup
3. **CSS Pointer Events**: Conflicting pointer-events settings preventing drag handle interaction
4. **Visual Feedback**: Hover and drag states weren't visible due to CSS specificity issues
5. **Coordinate Transformation**: Mouse position calculations needed to account for viewport transforms

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Handling
- Created `DragHelper` utility class for robust drag functionality
- Properly handles coordinate transformations with svg-pan-zoom
- Prevents event conflicts by disabling pan during drag operations

### 2. Fixed Tool Initialization
- Added automatic selection of 'select' tool on app startup
- Fixed tool button event listeners (was looking for `.tool-btn` class that didn't exist)
- Added proper aria-pressed states for accessibility

### 3. Improved Visual Feedback
- Updated CSS with stronger specificity using `!important` for critical states
- Added visual drag handle with dashed outline for debugging
- Enhanced hover effects with proper transitions
- Added grabbing cursor during drag

### 4. Fixed Pointer Events
- Set background grid and cabinet boundary to `pointer-events: none`
- Ensured drag handles have `pointer-events: all`
- Added very faint fill to drag handles to ensure mouse events are captured

### 5. Debugging Tools Added
- Created `dragDebug.js` module for development debugging
- Added visual debug mode toggle
- Created test pages for isolated drag testing

## Files Modified

1. `/src/elementFactory.js` - Implemented new drag system with DragHelper
2. `/src/main.js` - Fixed tool initialization and event listeners
3. `/index.html` - Updated CSS for better visual feedback
4. `/src/svgCanvas.js` - Improved mouse position calculations
5. `/src/utils/dragHelper.js` - New utility for drag functionality
6. `/src/debug/dragDebug.js` - Debug module for development

## Testing

To test the drag functionality:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the application in browser
3. Components should now be draggable when:
   - Select tool is active (default)
   - Clicking and dragging on the component body
   - Visual feedback shows on hover and during drag

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by:
1. Click the "Toggle Debug" button (bottom right)
2. Drag handles will be highlighted in red dashed lines
3. Console will show detailed drag events

## Known Limitations

- Drag only works in select mode (by design)
- Terminals are not draggable (they're for wire connections)
- Components snap to grid (50px intervals)

## Next Steps

- Test with multiple components
- Verify wire connections update during drag
- Test performance with many components
- Add touch support for mobile devices
